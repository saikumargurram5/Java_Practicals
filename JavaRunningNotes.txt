**************************Java****************************
its a programming language by this we can develop web applications, mobile applications, enterprice applications etc....
if we know java we can learn other languages easyly

Java is made by sun micro systems in 1995
now java becomes to Oracle.

Compiler + JDK => Java Requirements
process:- write code -> compile -> Run the code

java code -> Byte Code -> JVM -> 

Topics :-
Data types
Type Conversions & Casting
Type Preportion
Operators

Java Virtual Machine - resp to run lib for code
Java Runtime Env - resp to run code
Java Devp Kit - comb of JVM and JRE
Java is know as WORA - Write Oncs Reuse Anywhere

Understanding Data in real world  and Variables
Modulus -> int x=257
                         byte y = (byte) x;             257/256= rem =1
						 syso(y);                                 o/p = 1
						 
Operators :-
             Assignment Operators
			 Arthametic Operators
			 Incriment and decrement
			 comparision 
			 Logical

Control Statements :-
              If
			  If Else
			  While
			  Do While
			  For
			  For Each

Object :- properties and Behaviour
Class :- Blueprint to JVM to create object

JVM Memory Management :-
          Stack -> LIFO, Local var will get stored & Address of Obj
          Heap -> Objects( in objects Instance var will be there)
		  

Variables :-
        Local 
        Instance - Global var		


Array :-
        int num[] = {10,12,45,86};
		int exm[] = new int [5];
